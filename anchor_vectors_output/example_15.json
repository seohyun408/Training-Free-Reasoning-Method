The Moon’s orbit around Earth is shown with four key phases: new moon, first quarter, full moon, and third quarter, each labeled clearly.  \n3. The position marked as “F” is located directly opposite the Sun relative to Earth, indicating the Moon is fully illuminated from Earth’s perspective.  \n4. This alignment corresponds to the full moon phase, where the Earth is between the Sun and Moon, allowing the entire face of the Moon to be lit.  \n5. The diagram also shows that this position is associated with a “Spring tide,” confirming it is the full moon phase due to the alignment of gravitational forces.  \n\n<final>full moon</final>",
