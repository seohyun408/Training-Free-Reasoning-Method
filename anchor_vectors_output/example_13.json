        "1. The bluestem, labeled as a producer, forms the base of the food web by converting solar energy into biomass, which supports primary consumers like grasshoppers.\n2. Earthworms are labeled as decomposers, meaning they break down dead organic matter and recycle nutrients, which depends on the availability of such material from various sources, including plant litter from producers.\n3. If bluestem disappeared, primary consumers such as grasshoppers would lose a key food source, leading to a decline in their population, which would subsequently reduce the amount of organic matter available for decomposers.\n4. The decline in primary consumers would mean less organic waste and dead plant material from bluestem, reducing the food supply for earthworms, which rely on this material for sustenance.\n5. As the primary food source for decomposers is diminished, earthworm populations would likely decrease due to reduced nutrient availability and less organic matter to break down, making \"decrease\" the most logical outcome.\n\n<final>decrease</final>",
