Bluestem is identified as a producer, meaning it forms the base of the food chain by converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis.  \n3. The arrows in the food web connect bluestem to other organisms, including earthworms, suggesting earthworms consume organic material derived from bluestem.  \n4. If bluestem disappeared, the organic matter available for earthworms would decline, reducing their food source and potentially causing population decline.  \n5.
