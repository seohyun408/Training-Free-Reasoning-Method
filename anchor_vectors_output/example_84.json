Both illustrations depict leaves divided into multiple leaflets, which is the defining characteristic of compound leaves, not the overall growth or classification of plants.  \n4. The diagram does not show any stages of development, such as germination or maturation, nor does it illustrate how leaflets grow over time, making “Growth of Leaflets” an inaccurate description.  \n5.
