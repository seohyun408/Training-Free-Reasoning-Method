Without bluestem, primary consumers would lose their main food source, reducing their population and subsequently decreasing the food available for decomposers like earthworms.  \n3. Earthworms rely on organic matter from decaying plants, so a decline in plant biomass from bluestem disappearance would directly reduce their food supply, leading to a population decrease.  \n\n<final>decrease</final>",
