Equipment like pots, pans, and a stove are clearly visible through the window, confirming food is cooked within the vehicle.  \n3. The truck’s branding, “MILK TRUCK,” and its design suggest it is a mobile food service unit rather than a fixed location.  \n4. The presence of a menu board and a staff member preparing food further supports that this is a mobile kitchen, not a home or restaurant.  \n5. The truck’s location on a street and its operational setup rule out beach or home as plausible cooking locations.  \n\n<final>C. in truck</final>",
