Since OA and OC are radii of the circle, triangle OAC is isosceles with OA = OC, making angles ∠OAC and ∠OCA equal.  \n3. The given condition states that ∠OAC + ∠C = 50°, where ∠C refers to ∠ACB in triangle ABC.  \n4. In triangle OAC, the sum of angles is 180°, so ∠AOC = 180° - 2∠OAC.  \n5. Since ∠BAC is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC, its measure is half the measure of the central angle ∠BOC, which equals ∠AOC.  \n6. Substituting ∠OAC = x, then ∠OCA = x, and ∠C = 50° - x.  \n7. In triangle ABC, ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°, but we need to relate ∠BAC to the",
