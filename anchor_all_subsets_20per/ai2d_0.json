        "1. The diagram shows Earth’s orbit around the Sun with key dates marked: June 21 (Summer Solstice), December 22 (Winter Solstice), March 21 (Spring Equinox), and September 22 (Autumn Equinox).  \n2. The Solstices occur on June 21 and December 22, which are directly opposite each other in the annual cycle.  \n3. Counting the months between June 21 and December 22, we include July, August, September, October, November, and December — totaling six months.  \n4. The diagram visually confirms that the Solstices are separated by half the orbit, which corresponds to six months in the calendar.  \n5. Among the given options — 12, 4, 3, and 6 — only “6” accurately represents the number of months between the two Solstices.  \n\n<final>6</final>",
