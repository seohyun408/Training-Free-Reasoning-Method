        "1. The pizza is placed on a large metal tray, and only a portion of it is visible, indicating it is not a complete whole.  \n2. The visible slice occupies roughly half the area of the circular tray, suggesting it is approximately half the pizza.  \n3. The crust and toppings are evenly distributed across the visible portion, with no signs of asymmetry or uneven cutting.  \n4. The remaining portion of the pizza is not visible, but the visible half appears to be the only part left, implying the other half is missing or out of frame.  \n5. Based on the visual evidence, the visible portion corresponds to exactly half of the original pizza, making the correct fraction 1/2.  \n\n<final>D. 1/2</final>",
