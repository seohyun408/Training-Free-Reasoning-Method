      "reasoning_text": "1. Since AB is the diameter of circle O, any angle subtended by AB on the circumference is a right angle, meaning ∠ADB = 90° because it is inscribed in a semicircle.\n\n2. In triangle ABD, the sum of interior angles equals 180°, so ∠BAD = 180° - ∠ADB - ∠ABD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°.\n\n3. Angle C, or ∠ACB, is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB, which is the same arc subtended by angle ∠ADB.\n\n4. Since ∠ADB is 90°, the arc AB measures 180°, making ∠ACB also an inscribed angle subtending arc AB, and thus ∠ACB = ½ × 180° = 90° — but this contradicts the options.\n\n5.

        "1. Since AB is the diameter of circle O, any angle subtended by AB at the circumference is a right angle, meaning ∠ACB = 90° by the inscribed angle theorem.  \n2. The given angle ∠ABD = 54°, and since D lies on the circle, triangle ABD is inscribed in the circle with AB as the diameter.  \n3. In triangle ABD, angle at D (∠ADB) is 90° because it is subtended by the diameter AB, making triangle ABD a right-angled triangle.  \n4. The sum of angles in triangle ABD is 180°, so ∠BAD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°.  \n5. Angle C (∠ACB) is the angle subtended by arc AB at point C on the circumference, which is equal to 90°, but since we are asked for angle C in triangle ABC, and ∠CAB = ∠BAD = 36°, then ∠ACB = 90°, and ∠ABC = 180° - 90° - 36",
