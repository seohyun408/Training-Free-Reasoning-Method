        "1. Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AD = BC = 10.  \n2. F being the midpoint of AD means AF = FD = 5, as AD is divided equally.  \n3. FE is perpendicular to diagonal BD, forming a right triangle FED with EF = 4 as one leg.  \n4. In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles, so E lies on BD and FE is perpendicular to BD, making triangle FED a right triangle.  \n5. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle FED, FD² = FE² + ED² → 5² = 4² + ED² → 25 = 16 + ED² → ED² = 9 → ED = 3. Since E is on BD and diagonals bisect each other, BD = 2 × ED = 6, but this contradicts the options. Re-evaluating: since F is midpoint of AD, and FE ⊥ BD, and ABCD is a rhombus, the perpendicular from midpoint to diagonal implies symmetry. Actually, in a rhombus, the perpendicular from midpoint of a side to the diagonal creates a right triangle",
