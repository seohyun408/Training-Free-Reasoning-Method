The condition AD = DB indicates that point D is the midpoint of hypotenuse AB, as it divides AB into two equal segments.\n\n3. In a right triangle, the median drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse is exactly half the length of the hypotenuse, which is a well-known geometric theorem.\n\n4. Given that CD = 4, and CD is the median from C to hypotenuse AB, this median must be half the length of AB according to the theorem.\n\n5.
