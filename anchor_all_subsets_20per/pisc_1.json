The setting includes a brick wall, clothing racks, and a table with papers, which resembles a casual office or co-working space, not a formal corporate environment.  \n4. The woman’s expression and body language show engagement and interest, but not the formal demeanor expected in a commercial or strictly professional context.  \n5.
