The label “New moon” is placed directly above the dark circle at position F, confirming its identity within the lunar cycle.  \n4. The arrows and tidal labels (spring tide near F) further support that this position aligns with the new moon phase, where gravitational forces combine for extreme tides.  \n5.

        "1. The diagram illustrates the lunar phases and their relationship to tidal patterns, with the Sun, Earth, and Moon positioned in various alignments.  \n2. The Moon’s orbit around Earth is shown with four key phases: new moon, first quarter, full moon, and third quarter, each labeled clearly.  \n3. The position marked as “F” is located directly opposite the Sun relative to Earth, indicating the Moon is fully illuminated from Earth’s perspective.  \n4. This alignment corresponds to the full moon phase, where the Earth is between the Sun and Moon, allowing the entire face of the Moon to be lit.  \n5. The diagram also shows that this position is associated with a “Spring tide,” confirming it is the full moon phase due to the alignment of gravitational forces.  \n\n<final>full moon</final>",
