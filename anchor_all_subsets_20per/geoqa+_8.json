        "1. The figure shows two parallel lines, m and n, intersected by a transversal line, forming angles ∠1 and ∠2 at different points of intersection.  \n2. ∠1 is located above line m and to the right of the transversal, while ∠2 is located below line n and to the left of the transversal, indicating they are corresponding angles.  \n3. Since lines m and n are parallel, corresponding angles formed by a transversal are congruent, meaning ∠1 and ∠2 must have equal measures.  \n4. Given that ∠1 measures 62°, and ∠2 is its corresponding angle, ∠2 must also measure 62° due to the properties of parallel lines and transversals.  \n5. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 62°, as it matches the measure of ∠1 and satisfies the geometric relationship between corresponding angles when lines are parallel.\n\n<final>C. 62°</final>",
