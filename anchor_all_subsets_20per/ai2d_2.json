        "1. The diagram shows earthworms labeled as decomposers, indicating they break down organic matter and recycle nutrients in the ecosystem.  \n2. Bluestem is identified as a producer, meaning it forms the base of the food chain by converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis.  \n3. The arrows in the food web connect bluestem to other organisms, including earthworms, suggesting earthworms consume organic material derived from bluestem.  \n4. If bluestem disappeared, the organic matter available for earthworms would decline, reducing their food source and potentially causing population decline.  \n5. Since earthworms rely on decomposing material from producers like bluestem, their numbers would likely decrease without this primary source of nutrients.  \n\n<final>decrease</final>",
