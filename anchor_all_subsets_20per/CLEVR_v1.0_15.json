There are no other spherical objects in the image, so no other balls exist to compare material properties with.  \n3. The blue cube and yellow cylinder are not balls, so they are irrelevant to the question about balls.  \n4. Since only one ball (the green sphere) is present, it inherently shares its material with itself.  \n5. The question asks for the number of balls with the same material as the green object, and since there are no other balls, the count is zero.  \n\n<final>0</final>",
