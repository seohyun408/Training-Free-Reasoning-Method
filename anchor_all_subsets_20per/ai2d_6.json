The planula larva is depicted as a small, free-swimming form that eventually settles on a substrate, showing its role as a dispersal stage.\n3. After settling, the planula transforms into a polyp, which begins to grow and reproduce asexually, as shown by the arrow leading to “jeunes polypes.”\n4. The polyp then undergoes strobilation, producing multiple ephyrules that detach and develop into new medusae, as shown by the labeled arrow.\n5. The ephyrule stage directly follows the polyp’s strobilation and precedes the medusa stage, confirming it is the stage immediately after the polyp in the cycle.\n\n<final>eфyrule</final>",
