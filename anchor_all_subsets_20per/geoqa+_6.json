        "1. Triangle ABC is a right triangle with ∠ACB = 90°, and sides AC = 8 and AB = 10, so BC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: BC = √(AB² - AC²) = √(100 - 64) = √36 = 6.\n\n2. Point E lies on AB, and a perpendicular is drawn from E to AC, intersecting at point D, forming segment ED, which is the perpendicular bisector from E to AC.\n\n3. Since ED is perpendicular to AC and D lies on AC, ED is the height from E to side AC, and its length depends on the position of E along AB.\n\n4. The problem states that ED is a perpendicular bisector from E to AC, which implies that ED is perpendicular to AC and D is the midpoint of AC, so AD = DC = 4.\n\n5. Since ED is perpendicular to AC and D is the midpoint, triangle ADE is a right triangle with AD = 4 and AE as the hypotenuse. Using similar triangles or coordinate geometry, we can find ED = 3, as the triangle formed is a 3-4-5 right triangle scaled",
