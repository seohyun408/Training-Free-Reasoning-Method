      "reasoning_text": "1. Sandstone lacks a fixed crystal structure, which disqualifies it as a mineral since minerals must have ordered atomic arrangements in crystalline lattices.  \n2. Sandstone forms in distinct layers, indicating sedimentary origins rather than crystalline growth, a key feature of rocks.  \n3.

Sandstone is not made by organisms, eliminating biological origin, which distinguishes it from biochemical rocks and reinforces its classification as a sedimentary rock.  \n5.

        "1. Sandstone lacks a fixed crystal structure, which disqualifies it as a mineral since minerals require a defined crystalline lattice for their atomic arrangement.  \n2. It forms in distinct layers, indicating sedimentary processes that build up over time, a key characteristic of rocks rather than minerals.  \n3. Sandstone is naturally occurring and found in the Earth’s crust, aligning with the definition of a rock as a naturally formed aggregate of minerals or organic matter.  \n4. It is not produced by living organisms, which rules out biological origins and reinforces its classification as a non-organic sedimentary rock.  \n5. Sandstone is not a pure substance, as it consists of multiple mineral grains (like quartz, feldspar, and clay) cemented together, which is typical of rocks but not minerals.  \n\n<final>(B) rock</final>",
