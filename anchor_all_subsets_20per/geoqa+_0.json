        "1. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, so point O is the midpoint of both AC and BD, dividing the parallelogram into four triangles of equal area.  \n2. Since the total area of the parallelogram is 12, each of the four triangles formed by the diagonals has an area of 3.  \n3. Line EF passes through point O and intersects sides AD and BC, creating two additional triangles, AOE and BOF, whose areas need to be summed.  \n4. Due to the symmetry of the parallelogram and the fact that O is the midpoint, triangles AOE and COF are congruent, and triangles BOF and DOE are congruent.  \n5. The sum of the areas of triangles AOE and BOF equals half the area of the parallelogram minus the areas of triangles COF and DOE, which are equal to AOE and BOF respectively, so their sum is exactly half of 12, which is 6, but since the question asks for AOE + BOF, and considering the symmetry and equal division, the correct answer is 3.  \n\n<final>B. 3</final>",
