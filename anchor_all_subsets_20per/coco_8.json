The vehicles are large public transit buses, consistent with the type of vehicles operated by a metropolitan transit authority rather than a car or bicycle manufacturer.  \n3. The MTA logo is prominently displayed on the side of the bus, indicating direct affiliation with the organization that owns and operates these vehicles.  \n4. The setting, including the elevated train tracks and urban infrastructure, matches typical MTA service areas in New York City or surrounding regions.  \n5.
