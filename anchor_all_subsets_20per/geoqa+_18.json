        "1. The diagram shows a semicircular protractor with points A, B, and C positioned on its arc, indicating angles measured from the center.  \n2. Point A corresponds to an angle of 86°, and point B corresponds to an angle of 30°, both measured from the baseline of the protractor.  \n3. Point C lies on the semicircle, and the angle ∠ACB is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc AB.  \n4. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc, which is the difference between the angles at A and B: 86° - 30° = 56°.  \n5. Therefore, ∠ACB = 56° / 2 = 28°, as the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc’s measure.  \n\n<final>B. 28°</final>",
