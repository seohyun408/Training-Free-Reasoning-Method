        "1. Since triangle ABC is a right triangle with ∠C = 90°, and AB = 10, BC = 6, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC. Calculating AC = √(AB² - BC²) = √(100 - 36) = √64 = 8.\n\n2. The segment DE is perpendicular to AB, forming a smaller right triangle ADE similar to triangle ABC because both share ∠A and have right angles at E and C respectively.\n\n3. The similarity ratio between triangles ADE and ABC is determined by the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since DE corresponds to BC, the ratio is DE/BC = 2.4/6 = 0.4.\n\n4. Since AD corresponds to AC in the similar triangles, we can find AD by multiplying AC by the similarity ratio: AD = AC × 0.4 = 8 × 0.4 = 3.2.\n\n5. However, 3.2 is not among the given options, indicating a possible error in the problem or options. Rechecking the problem, if DE = 2.4 and BC = 6, the ratio is 0.4",
