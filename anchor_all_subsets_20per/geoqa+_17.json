In triangle ABC, the sum of interior angles is 180°, and since ∠ACB = 90° and ∠ABC = 70°, the remaining angle ∠BAC = 180° - 90° - 70° = 20°.\n\n3. ∠BDC and ∠BAC both subtend the same arc BC on the circle, so they are equal as angles in the same segment.\n\n4. Therefore, ∠BDC = ∠BAC = 20°, as both angles are inscribed angles subtending the same arc BC.\n\n5.
