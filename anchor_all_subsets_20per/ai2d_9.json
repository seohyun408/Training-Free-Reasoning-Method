This directional flow signifies a feeding relationship where the coyote benefits by obtaining energy, while the antelope is consumed.  \n3. The arrow’s direction confirms the antelope is at a lower trophic level and the coyote is at a higher level, consistent with predation.  \n4. No other arrows connect the antelope and coyote in a way that suggests competition, mutualism, or parasitism, eliminating those options.  \n5.
