Then, from point B, it travels 40 nautical miles in a direction 20° north of west to reach point C. The distance between points A and C is ()  \nA. 30 nautical miles  \nB. 40 nautical miles  \nC. 50 nautical miles  \nD. 60 nautical miles",
      "reasoning_text": "1. The ship travels 40 nautical miles from A to B on a 40° south of west bearing, which corresponds to a 220° angle measured clockwise from true north.  \n2. From B, it proceeds 40 nautical miles on a 20° north of west bearing, equivalent to a 320° direction from true north.  \n3. The angle at point B between the two legs of the journey is calculated as the difference between 320° and 220°, resulting in a 100° interior angle.  \n4. Since both AB and BC are equal (40 nautical miles), triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC and vertex angle at B being 100°, making base angles at A and C each 40°.  \n5. Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle ABC, AC² = AB² + BC² - 2·AB·BC·cos(100°), which simplifies to AC² = 40² + 40² - 2·40·40·cos(100°) ≈ 30 nautical miles.",

The ship travels from point A to point B in a direction 40° south of west, which means the angle between the north direction and the path AB is 180° + 40° = 220° from the positive x-axis, or equivalently, 40° below the negative x-axis.\n\n2. From point B, the ship travels 40 nautical miles in a direction 20° north of west, meaning the angle between the north direction and the path BC is 180° - 20° = 160° from the positive x-axis, or equivalently, 20° above the negative x-axis.\n\n3. The angle at point B between the two legs of the journey (AB and BC) can be calculated as the difference between the two directions: 40° (south of west) and 20° (north of west), which gives an internal angle of 40° + 20° = 60°.\n\n4. Since both legs AB and BC are of equal length (40 nautical miles), triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = BC = 40 nautical miles and the",
