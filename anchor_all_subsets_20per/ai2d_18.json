This structure is surrounded by \"Vent fill\" and sits above the \"Host rock or sediments,\" indicating it is the remnant of a volcanic conduit.  \n4. The other labels, such as \"Pyroclastic deposits,\" \"Lake,\" and \"Collapsed walls of crater,\" refer to surface or crater features, not the central volcanic conduit.  \n5.
