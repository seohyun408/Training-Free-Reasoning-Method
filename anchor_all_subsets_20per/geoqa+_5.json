      "reasoning_text": "1. The regular pentagon has interior angles of 108° each, calculated as (5-2)×180°/5, and the square has 90° interior angles, confirming the geometric context of the figure.\n\n2. The square’s side AB aligns with the pentagon’s side AB, meaning their shared side forms a straight line, and the adjacent sides of both shapes are equal in length.\n\n3. The angle ∠1 is formed at vertex A between side AE of the pentagon and side AG of the square, requiring calculation based on the pentagon’s interior angle and the square’s right angle.\n\n4. The pentagon’s interior angle at A is 108°, and since the square’s angle at A is 90°, the angle between the square’s side and the pentagon’s side AE is 108° – 90° = 18°, which is ∠1.\n\n5.

        "1. The regular pentagon has interior angles of 108°, calculated using the formula (n-2)×180°/n for n=5.  \n2. The square has interior angles of 90°, as all its angles are right angles by definition.  \n3. At vertex A, the angle of the pentagon (108°) is adjacent to the square’s angle (90°), forming a linear pair with the remaining angle ∠1.  \n4. The sum of angles around point A is 360°, so ∠1 = 360° - 108° - 90° = 162°, but this is incorrect as it ignores the geometric configuration.  \n5. The correct approach is to recognize that ∠1 is the angle between the side of the pentagon and the side of the square, which is the difference between the pentagon’s interior angle and the square’s interior angle: 108° - 90° = 18°.  \n\n<final>B. 18°</final>",
