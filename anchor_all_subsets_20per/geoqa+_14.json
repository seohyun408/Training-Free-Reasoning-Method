Point C lies on the semicircle, so angle ACB is a right angle by Thales’ theorem, making triangle ACB a right triangle with hypotenuse AB.  \n3. Given AC:BC = 4:3, let AC = 4k and BC = 3k; using the Pythagorean theorem, (4k)² + (3k)² = 10² → 16k² + 9k² = 100 → 25k² = 100 → k² = 4 → k = 2.  \n4. Thus, AC = 8 cm and BC = 6 cm. Since OD ⊥ BC and O is the center, OD is the perpendicular distance from O to chord BC, which can be calculated using the area of triangle OBC.  \n5.

        "1. Since AB is the diameter of the semicircle and C lies on the circle, angle ACB is a right angle by the inscribed angle theorem, making triangle ABC a right triangle with the right angle at C.\n\n2. Given AC:BC = 4:3 and AB = 10 cm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of AC and BC. Let AC = 4x and BC = 3x, so (4x)² + (3x)² = 10² → 16x² + 9x² = 100 → 25x² = 100 → x² = 4 → x = 2. Thus, AC = 8 cm and BC = 6 cm.\n\n3. Since OD is perpendicular to BC and O is the center of the semicircle, OD is the distance from the center O to the chord BC. In a circle, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord, so D is the midpoint of BC.\n\n4. Since BC = 6 cm, BD = DC = 3 cm. Triangle ODB is a right triangle with OD as one leg, BD = ",
