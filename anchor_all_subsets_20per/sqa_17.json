The upward-facing south pole of the bottom magnet is directly opposite the upward-facing north pole of the top magnet.  \n3. Magnetic poles interact such that opposite poles attract and like poles repel, which applies here since north and south face each other.  \n4. The alignment ensures the south pole of the lower magnet and the north pole of the upper magnet are in direct opposition, creating an attractive force between them.  \n5.
