        "1. A black horse stands prominently in the center, harnessed to a carriage, its head turned slightly toward the viewer, adorned with decorative red elements on its bridle.  \n2. The carriage, positioned behind the horse, features a dark canopy and wooden wheels with visible spokes, suggesting a traditional design suited for rural travel.  \n3. The scene unfolds along a light-colored dirt road that stretches diagonally across the canvas, flanked by green fields and sparse vegetation, creating a sense of depth.  \n4. In the background, a large, rounded mountain looms under a muted sky, with faint outlines of buildings or structures nestled at its base, hinting at a distant settlement.  \n5. The painting’s brushwork is visible and textured, particularly in the sky and foliage, conveying an impressionistic style that emphasizes atmosphere over precise detail.  \n\n<final>Key elements include a black horse with decorative bridle, a traditional carriage, a dirt road, expansive fields, a distant mountain, and impressionistic brushwork.</final>",
