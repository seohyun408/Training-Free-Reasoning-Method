        "1. Since AB is the diameter of circle O, any angle subtended by AB at the circumference, such as ∠ACB, must be a right angle (90°) by the inscribed angle theorem.  \n2. Triangle ABC is a right triangle with ∠ACB = 90°, and ∠A is given as 30°, so the sum of angles in triangle ABC must be 180°.  \n3. The third angle, ∠ABC, can be found by subtracting the known angles from 180°: 180° - 90° - 30° = 60°.  \n4. This calculation confirms that ∠ABC is exactly 60°, matching the geometric properties of a right triangle with a 30° angle.  \n5. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, as it directly corresponds to the calculated value of ∠ABC.\n\n<final>C. 60°</final>",
