Which of the following statements is true?\nContext: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.\nOptions: (A) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (B) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. (C) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.",

Both pairs show identical magnets with north and south poles facing each other, indicating consistent magnetic polarity alignment and material composition across all magnets.  \n2. The distance between magnets in Pair 1 is 13 mm, while in Pair 2 it is 31 mm, meaning Pair 2’s magnets are significantly farther apart.  \n3. Magnetic force diminishes with increasing distance, so Pair 2’s greater separation inherently reduces the attractive force compared to Pair 1.  \n4. Since all magnets are identical, the only variable affecting force strength is distance, and Pair 2’s larger gap directly correlates with weaker magnetic interaction.  \n5. Therefore, the correct statement is that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2, as the distance difference outweighs any other potential variables.\n\n<final>B</final>",

The distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is 13 mm, while the distance in Pair 2 is 31 mm, making Pair 2 significantly farther apart.  \n3. Magnetic force decreases with increasing distance, following an inverse square law, so the force between magnets is stronger when they are closer together.  \n4. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are much closer than those in Pair 2, the magnetic repulsion between them will be noticeably stronger in Pair 1.  \n5.
