Point E lies on hypotenuse AB, and a perpendicular is drawn from E to side AC, intersecting it at point D. This creates a smaller right triangle ADE similar to triangle ABC.  \n3. Since DE is perpendicular to AC and AB is the hypotenuse, DE is the altitude from E to AC. The length of DE depends on the position of E along AB.  \n4. The perpendicular bisector of AB implies that E is the midpoint of AB, because a perpendicular bisector intersects a segment at its midpoint and is perpendicular to it.  \n5. With E as the midpoint of AB, the length of DE can be found using similar triangles or coordinate geometry. Since triangle ADE ~ triangle ABC, the ratio of corresponding sides is AE/AB = 1/2.
