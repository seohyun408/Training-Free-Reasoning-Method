Red-tailed hawks, as aerial hunters, possess similarly formidable talons and strong feet adapted for grabbing and killing birds or rodents during mid-air or ground strikes.  \n4. Pygmy hippos, being semi-aquatic mammals, have hooves for walking on land and swimming, but their feet lack the sharp, gripping claws essential for grabbing prey like fish or small mammals.  \n5.

The white-tailed eagle’s feet are specialized with sharp, curved talons designed to firmly grasp slippery fish and agile mammals, showcasing evolutionary adaptation for its piscivorous and carnivorous diet.\n2. Red-tailed hawks, as raptors, possess similarly powerful feet equipped with sharp talons that enable them to seize and hold prey such as rodents, birds, and reptiles with precision and strength.\n3. Pygmy hippos, being semi-aquatic herbivores, have hooves adapted for walking on land and swimming in water, not for grasping or catching prey, as their diet consists mainly of vegetation.\n4. Both the white-tailed eagle and red-tailed hawk are birds of prey, sharing the trait of having feet with sharp, curved talons for capturing and securing live prey during hunting.\n5.
