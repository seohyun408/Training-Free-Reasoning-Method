        "1. The regular pentagon has interior angles of 108°, calculated as (5-2)×180°/5, and the square has interior angles of 90°.\n2. At vertex A, the angle of the pentagon (108°) and the square (90°) share a common side, forming a 18° gap between them.\n3. Since ∠1 is the angle between the side of the square and the side of the pentagon, it must be the difference between the pentagon’s interior angle and 90°, which is 108° - 90° = 18°.\n4. The geometry of the figure ensures that the angle ∠1 is formed between the extension of the square’s side and the pentagon’s side, which directly equals the gap of 18°.\n5. The answer is 18°, as it matches the calculated difference and the visual layout of the figure.\n\n<final>B. 18°</final>",
