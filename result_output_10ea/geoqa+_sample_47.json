But I think I need to reconsider because angle CPA is not directly an inscribed angle subtending arc CA. 8. Let's use a different approach: since AB is the diameter and CD is perpendicular to AB, then the arc AD equals arc AC, and each is half of arc ACB, which is 90°, so each is 45°. 9. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think about angles subtended by arcs. 10. Since angle BCD = 50°, and it is an inscribed angle, it subtends arc BD. 11. The measure",

                "might be constant regardless of P’s position on CD"
