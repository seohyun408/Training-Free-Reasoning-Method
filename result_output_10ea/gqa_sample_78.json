Since the tiles are described as being \"predominantly white\" and forming the main flooring material, it can be inferred that their primary color is white, even if some may appear slightly off-white due to external factors. 6. The contrast with the darker brown border tiles further reinforces that the small tiles are intended to be white, as the border tiles are specifically mentioned as being a different color. 7. Therefore, the small tiles do have white color, and this is consistent with the visual description provided.\n\nFinal Answer: Yes, the small tiles have white color.",
