                "Let me try to relate these properly: 7. In triangle AOC, since OA = OC, we have ∠OAC = ∠OCA",
                "3. Given that ∠OAC + ∠C = 50°, and since ∠OAC = ∠OCA (by isosceles triangle AOC), we can substitute: 2∠OAC + ∠C = 50°. 4. But ∠C is ∠ACB, which is an angle in triangle ABC. 5. In triangle AOC, ∠AOC is the central angle subtending arc AC. 6. In triangle ABC, ∠BAC is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc AC. 7. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. So, ∠BAC = ½ ∠AOC. 8. From triangle AOC, we have 2∠OAC + ∠AOC = 180°, and we know 2∠OAC + ∠C = 50°. So, ∠AOC = 180° - 2∠OAC, and ∠C = 50° - 2∠OAC. 9. But ∠C is ∠ACB, which",

                "The next step: 4. In triangle AOC, since OA = OC, we have ∠OAC = ∠OCA. Let’s denote each as x, so ∠OAC = ∠OCA = x. 5. Then, ∠AOC = 180° - 2x. 6. Now, since ∠OAC + ∠C = 50°, and ∠OAC = x, then x + ∠C = 50°. But ∠C = ∠ACB = ∠OCA + ∠OCB. 7. However, we can use the fact that ∠AOC is the central angle, and ∠ABC is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc AC. Therefore, ∠ABC = 1/2 ∠AOC. 8. So, ∠AOC = 2∠ABC"
