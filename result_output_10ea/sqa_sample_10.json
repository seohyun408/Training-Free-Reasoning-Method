They found a sea turtle that glowed! The turtle's shell was bright red and green. This was a new discovery. Scientists had never seen a sea turtle with a glowing shell before.\nScientists want to know why these turtles have a shell that glows. Sadly, there are not many of these turtles left in the world. So, it is hard to learn about them.\nOptions: (A) a sea turtle that can fly (B) a sea turtle with a glowing shell",
      "reasoning_text": "1. The scientists were originally searching for sharks, indicating their initial objective was unrelated to sea turtles, yet they stumbled upon an unexpected marine creature.  \n2. The sea turtle they discovered exhibited a bright red and green luminescence on its shell, which is a rare and visually striking trait.  \n3. This glowing shell is a phenomenon never documented before in sea turtles, making it a completely new scientific observation.  \n4. The rarity of these turtles in the wild complicates further study, as scientists struggle to gather sufficient data about their glowing trait.  \n5. The discovery of a sea turtle with a glowing shell aligns perfectly with option (B), as no other option matches the glowing shell described in the passage.  \n<final>(B) a sea turtle with a glowing shell</final>",

        "1. The scientists were originally searching for sharks in the ocean environment, indicating their primary focus was on marine predators.  \n2. During their search, they unexpectedly encountered a sea turtle exhibiting unusual bioluminescence, which immediately caught their attention.  \n3. The turtle’s shell displayed vibrant red and green hues, a phenomenon never previously documented in any sea turtle species.  \n4. This discovery represents a completely new and rare biological trait, making it a groundbreaking finding in marine biology.  \n5. Scientists now face the challenge of studying this rare species due to its critically low population, limiting their ability to understand its glowing shell’s purpose.  \n<final>(B) a sea turtle with a glowing shell</final>",
