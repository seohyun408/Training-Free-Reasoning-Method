Since AC is parallel to OB, and OA is a transversal, then ∠OAC and ∠AOB are alternate interior angles? Or perhaps ∠OAC and ∠BOA are alternate interior angles. Let me draw this mentally: point A, O, B, with AC parallel to OB. OA connects O to A. The angle between OA and AC is ∠OAC. The angle between OA and OB is",

Since AC is parallel to OB, and OA is a transversal, the alternate interior angles ∠OAC and ∠AOB should be equal. 7. Actually, let me reconsider the figure. Since AC || OB, and OA is the transversal, then ∠OAC and ∠AOB are alternate interior angles, so ∠O",
