The pizza appears to be cut into standard slices, and approximately half of the pizza is visible, while the other half is out of frame or obscured.\n3. The visible portion covers roughly half the circular area of the tray, indicating that the remaining half is either missing or not shown in the image.\n4. The toppings, including cheese, mushrooms, onions, and black olives, are evenly distributed across the visible section, supporting the idea that it’s half the pizza.\n5. The slice angles and the way the pizza is arranged further confirm that it represents exactly half of the whole, making the fraction 1/2.\n\n<final>D. 1/2</final>",
