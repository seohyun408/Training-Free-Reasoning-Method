This book’s audience is likely individuals seeking spiritual growth, holistic health, or alternative healing practices—not professionals in education or training. 8. **Purpose and Intent**: The purpose of this book is to guide readers in self-healing and spiritual alignment through chakra and crystal work. A pedagogy book, by contrast, aims to equip educators with methods to effectively teach students.
